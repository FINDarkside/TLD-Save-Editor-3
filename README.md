**Fork edit:**

Very impressed by the incredible work that has been put into this.
Just added couple of items of choice from the new updates because no commits have been made in some time.
Couldn't figure out how to add the new recipes. They are in the availableItems and the gear name is correct, although in-game it doesn't unlock the new recipes.
